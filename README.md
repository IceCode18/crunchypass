# Crunchypass: Crunchyroll Guest Pass Sharing Website
This is a simple website that allows Crunchyroll Premium users to share their guest passes with other users. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and AWS services such as EC2 and DynamoDB.

<h3>The problem it solved: </h3>

Crunchyroll, an anime streaming website, used to have a feature called "Guest Pass" that allowed Crunchyroll Premium members to share their subscription benefits with anyone who is not subscribed to Premium. A Guest Pass provides a free trial period of Premium membership for a limited time, usually 48 hours, to the recipient. This allowed them to access Premium benefits, such as ad-free streaming, HD video quality, and access to simulcast episodes as they air in Japan. Crunchyroll Premium members would receive a limited number of guest passes each month to give away. However, there wasn't any platform for premium users to share their code with others. They would just post their codes in the comment section of anime episodes, but bots would steal them instantly. Crunchypass solved that problem by providing a platform for users to share their codes and make the process a little more interesting. It made code sharing more fun and fair for everyone. Premium users had the option to protect their code by creating a challenge that non-premium users have to solve in order to access. If they don't make a custom challenge, the website will automatically shuffle the code.

<h3>Usage</h3>

* Premium users can post their guest pass codes on the website by entering their code and an optional custom challenge
* Non-premium users can browse the available guest pass codes and attempt to solve the challenges to access them
* Upon solving a challenge, the user will gain access to the guest pass code and can redeem it on Crunchyroll
